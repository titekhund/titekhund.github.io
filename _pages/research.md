<h3>European Sovereign Debt Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning and NMPC</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Publication:</b> Social Science Research Network (SSRN)</li>
<li><b>Date:</b> 2024</li>
<li><b>Authors:</b> Tato Khundadze, W. Semmler</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> Accepted at AI for Human Learning and Behavior Change Journal (2025)</li>
<li><b>Summary:</b> This paper explores the use of advanced computational methods, specifically deep reinforcement learning and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), to manage and control European sovereign debt, offering a novel approach to fiscal policy and stability. It introduces a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework for cooperative fiscal and monetary policy coordination across multiple macroeconomic regions.</li>
