I’m a PhD candidate in Economics at The New School, specializing in machine learning applications to macroeconomic modeling and economic dynamics.

My research integrates:
- Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
- SINDy for nonlinear model discovery
- Econometrics for policy design

I’ve worked with UNDP, CEP, and currently teach undergraduate and graduate-level courses in econometrics and ML.
