        <h3>European Sovereign Debt Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning and NMPC</h3>
        <p class="authors"><strong>Tato Khundadze</strong>, W. Semmler</p>
        <p class="publication-details"><em>Social Science Research Network (SSRN)</em>, 2024</p>
        <p class="summary">This paper explores the use of advanced computational methods, specifically deep reinforcement learning and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), to manage and control European sovereign debt, offering a novel approach to fiscal policy and stability. It introduces a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework for cooperative fiscal and monetary policy coordination across multiple macroeconomic regions.</p>

        <h3>NEOLIBERAL LOCK-IN: Why Georgia-EU Free Trade Does Not Work</h3>
        <p class="authors"><strong>Tato Khundadze</strong>, Salome Topuria</p>
        <p class="publication-details"><em>Social Science Research Network (SSRN)</em>, 2022</p>
        <p class="summary">This paper analyzes Georgia's trade with the EU following the 2014 DCFTA. It argues that trade dynamics have not improved and the quality of Georgia's export basket has deteriorated, showing a decrease in sophistication and a rise in low-tech and resource-based products.</p>

        <h3>Time to build factories â€“ again</h3>
        <p class="authors"><strong>Tato Khundadze</strong></p>
        <p class="publication-details"><em>International Politics and Society (IPS-Journal)</em>, 2019</p>
